Assalamualaikum habibi!!

Brokarim disini.  
And honestly… I never know how to introduce myself.

I could say **“I’m a programmer”**,  
but what I mostly do is using Claude Code Max Mode, Opus 4.5, running semi-supervised Ralph Wiggum loops to generate agentic B2B SaaS.

I could say **“I like building stuff”**,  
but I’ve never touched **$1M ARR** —  
not even spiritually.

I could say **“I like writing”**,  
but…  
I’ll start tomorrow.  
I promise. 👉👌

But I *do* like sharing programming thoughts, tiny lessons, and unfiltered dev yapping on my [thread](https://www.threads.com/@brokariim).

So now I’m stuck.

I’m 23,5.  
No car.  
No yacht.  
No girl friends.  
No “I quit my job at 23”.

Just vibes, side projects, and an unhealthy relationship with GitHub stars.

But somehow, I still really enjoy this.

I like turning small, annoying problems into tools.  
I like reading other people’s code way too slowly.  
I like shipping imperfect things and learning in public.

Maybe that’s enough.

title: Building a Motion-Ready Hand-Drawn Signature Generator (Mask-Based Animation)

---

This project started in the most unplanned way possible.

I wasn’t trying to build a signature tool.  
I was just experimenting with motion and SVG masking.

One small prototype turned into:

> “Wait… this could actually be a nice exportable signature component.”

And that’s how the Hand-Drawn Signature project was born.

Not as a SaaS idea.  
Not as a startup experiment.  
Just pure vibe coding.

## The Core Idea

Most “signature generators” stop at exporting an image.

I wanted something different:

- Motion-ready  
- React-ready  
- Drop-in component  
- Clean SVG output  

Instead of exporting a PNG, this tool exports a usable `tsx` component you can drop into a portfolio, landing page, or personal site.

The signature isn’t just static.

It animates.

## Two Approaches to Signature Animation

There are generally two ways to animate handwriting in SVG:

### 1. Stroke Animation (`pathLength` trick)

You animate strokes from `0 → 1` using `pathLength`.

This simulates the drawing process directly.

It’s great for line-based signatures.

---

### 2. Mask-Based Reveal (What I Used)

Instead of animating strokes, I animate visibility.

The idea:

- Render full SVG paths
- Apply a `<mask>`
- Animate a rectangle inside the mask
- Reveal the signature progressively

This creates a smooth “written from left to right” illusion without relying on stroke-only paths.

It works beautifully for:
- Filled glyphs
- Signature fonts
- More complex shapes

And it keeps the output clean.

## How the Animation Works

Under the hood:

- SVG paths are rendered with sequential timing
- A `motion.rect` animates from width `0 → full width`
- Custom easing makes it feel natural
- Optional ink-indent layer adds depth for a more realistic fill effect

Because the animation is mask-based, we’re not manipulating dozens of stroke properties.

We’re simply controlling visibility.

Simple idea. Powerful result.

## The Technical Stack

The project is built using:

- React
- SVG
- `motion` (for animation control)
- Canvas API (for drawing mode)
- Dynamic export logic (`lib/signature/export.ts`)

The export function generates:

- A clean `motion.svg`
- Mask definition
- Properly scoped IDs
- Production-ready component structure

No extra junk. No runtime editor dependency.

Just copy → paste → done.

## Draw or Type

There are two input modes:

### ✍️ Draw Mode

Users draw directly on a canvas.  
The tool converts strokes into SVG paths.

### ⌨️ Type Mode

Users type their name using a signature-style font.  
The glyphs are converted into SVG paths and masked for animation.

Both end up as motion-ready components.

## Why Export Code Instead of Media?

Because:

- Video exports are heavy.
- GIFs are low quality.
- PNGs are static.

A React component is:

- Lightweight
- Resolution independent
- Fully controllable
- Replayable
- Theme-aware

It becomes part of your UI system, not just decoration.

---

## What’s Next

This is still a fun project.

Upcoming ideas:

- Signature template gallery
- Public showcase page
- Export to MP4 / PNG / SVG
- Font presets and sizing controls
- Multi-line signature support
- Custom easing presets

## Final Thoughts

This wasn’t meant to be a product.

It started as a motion experiment.

But sometimes the best projects come from curiosity, not planning.

And honestly?

There’s something satisfying about seeing your signature animate itself into existence on your own website.

That just hits different.

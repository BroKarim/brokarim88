## 🌱 zonapetik 

Let me be honest.

**zonapetik** started as a *college research*—offered by one of my lecturers.  
At that time, I wasn’t exactly excited. Not because of the lecturer… but because the topic was **data mining**.  
I’ve never really liked it. Too many numbers, too many charts, too little joy.

But there was one powerful motivation:  
**I just wanted to graduate as soon as possible.**

So I said yes.

### Plot twist

Turns out, instead of fully focusing on *my* project, I somehow ended up **helping the lecturer finish *their* tasks**, which—surprisingly—had *nothing* to do with the original project scope.

So yeah, while building a weather-based agricultural system, I was also:
- fixing unrelated stuff  
- explaining technical things that weren’t my job  
- occasionally questioning my life choices  

Very productive. For everyone except me.

### Somehow… it worked

Despite all that, **zonapetik** still got finished.

It became a **data-driven agricultural decision support system** that analyzes weather data, forecasts rainfall using **Holt-Winters**, and generates a **dynamic planting calendar** instead of static dates farmers usually rely on.

Not bad for a project that started with pure survival instinct.

### A friendly message for juniors 👀

If there’s one lesson here, it’s this:

> Don’t just choose a project.  
> **Choose your supervisor wisely.**

A simple project with a *“comfortable”* lecturer can score higher  
than a complex, well-built system guided by a *“special character”* lecturer.  
Life isn’t always fair—rubrics definitely aren’t.

### So… what is zonapetik?

In short:

- A **weather-based planting decision system**
- Uses **real climate data** (BMKG, NASA)
- Applies **time-series forecasting**
- Generates **adaptive planting calendars**
- Built with a clean, modular web architecture

It’s practical, scalable, and—most importantly—  
**proof that even a reluctant data-mining project can turn into something solid.**

Would I choose this path again?

…probably not 😄  
But hey, it got me closer to graduation—and that counts.

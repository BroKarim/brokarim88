Not everything I’ve built is fully shipped — and that’s intentional.

Alongside the projects you see live, there are several others that played an important role in my **programming journey**.  
These projects were where I experimented, broke things, and learned how real systems work.

If you’re curious, most of them live here:

## Building My Own UI Library

One of the most formative side projects was a **custom UI library**.

It started as an experiment inspired by **shadcn/ui**, but with a different focus.

Instead of building many components first, I focused on **theme testing**.

I wanted to answer a simple question:

> *How does the same UI feel when the theme changes dramatically?*

To do this, I cloned **Magic UI** (a popular shadcn-based repository) and heavily modified it.

Through this project, I learned a lot about:
- Component registries
- MDX-driven documentation
- Design tokens and theme primitives
- How shadcn’s copy-paste architecture actually works under the hood
- Separating “style” from “structure” in a scalable way

It wasn’t about shipping a library.  
It was about understanding how one is built.

## Headshota (Paused)

**Headshota** is an open-source web app for generating **natural, professional-looking AI headshots** for social media — from a single photo.

> ⚠️ **Status: Paused / In Progress**

### What It Does
- Upload one photo
- Choose headshot styles
- Apply subtle enhancement filters
- Generate realistic AI headshots
- Manage results in a personal dashboard

The goal was **photorealism**, closer to a light Photoshop retouch than obvious AI output.

### Why It’s Paused
- High image generation costs (tokens add up fast)
- A tricky image corruption bug during download
- Fixing it properly requires repeated paid tests

### What’s Already Built
- Landing page (static data)
- Auth with Better Auth (Google OAuth)
- User dashboard
- Full image generation flow
- AWS S3 storage
- Supabase + Prisma for metadata

Most of the system works — it’s just waiting for time, budget, and a clean fix.

These projects may not all be finished,  
but each one pushed me forward as a builder.

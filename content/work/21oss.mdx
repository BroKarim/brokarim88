21OSS is an **open-source resource hub** for developers and creators. It curates templates, components, tools, and assets that help you move faster from idea to shipped product.

No noise. No fluff.  
Just practical, open-source resources that actually ship.

## Why I Built This

I’ve always believed open source is one of the most powerful forces in tech. But discovering *good* open-source resources is still harder than it should be.

Great templates are buried deep in repositories.  
Useful components are scattered across tweets and blog posts. Assets live everywhere with no context, no curation, and no clear starting point.

I built **21OSS** to solve that problem.

This is a place where developers, designers, and makers can:

- Discover high-quality open-source resources  
- Understand what’s actually useful in real projects  
- Spend less time searching and more time building  

It’s not about collecting everything.  
It’s about **curating what works**.

If this helps someone ship faster, learn better, or avoid decision fatigue — even once — then this project has done its job.

## 🏗 Architecture

21OSS is built with a modern, production-ready stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15  
- **Database**: Supabase  
- **Authentication**: Better Auth  
- **Storage**: AWS S3  
- **ORM**: Prisma  

The focus is on performance, scalability, and a clean developer experience — so the platform itself never gets in the way of shipping.

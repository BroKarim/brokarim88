21OSS is an **open-source resource hub** for developers and creators.  
It curates templates, components, tools, and assets that help you move faster — from idea to shipped product.

No noise. No fluff.  
Just practical, open-source resources that actually ship.

## 🌟 Why I Built This

I’ve always believed open source is one of the most powerful forces in tech.  
But discovering *good* open-source resources is still harder than it should be.

Great templates are buried deep in repositories.  
Useful components are scattered across tweets and blog posts.  
Assets live everywhere — with no context, no curation, and no clear starting point.

I built **21OSS** to solve that problem.

This is a place where developers, designers, and makers can:

- Discover high-quality open-source resources  
- Understand what’s actually useful in real projects  
- Spend less time searching and more time building  

It’s not about collecting everything.  
It’s about **curating what works**.

If this helps someone ship faster, learn better, or avoid decision fatigue — even once — then this project has done its job.

## 🏗 Architecture

21OSS is built with a modern, production-ready stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15  
- **Database**: Supabase  
- **Authentication**: Better Auth  
- **Storage**: AWS S3  
- **ORM**: Prisma  

The focus is on performance, scalability, and a clean developer experience — so the platform itself never gets in the way of shipping.

OG Table is a small project — but it started from a **big technical challenge**.

This project began as a **clone of a popular open-source repository**:
<br />
<InlineCode code="https://github.com/raycast/ray-so" language="bash" />

`ray.so` is a polished product by **Raycast**, a well-known company focused on developer tools — specifically, generating beautiful **code snippet images**.

I chose this repo not just because the UI matched what I wanted, but because I was curious:

> *How does a real company structure, design, and ship a product-quality open-source project?*

The challenge wasn’t cloning it.  
The challenge was **changing its core purpose entirely**.

Instead of code snippets, I wanted the output to be **dynamic, styled tables**.

And that changed everything.

## Why Tables?

This came from a very real, very personal problem.

I was working on a slide deck.  
The typography looked great.  
The layout felt modern.

Then I added a table.

It instantly broke the entire design.

It looked like something from an early-2000s spreadsheet — rigid, lifeless, and completely out of place.

That moment sparked a simple but frustrating question:

> “Why does everything look modern… except tables?”

## Reworking a Solid Foundation

OG Table wasn’t built from zero.

It was built by **reworking a clean, mature codebase** that was originally designed for something else entirely.

I had to:

- Understand how ray.so rendered and exported code snippets  
- Identify which abstractions could be reused  
- Replace static code blocks with **fully customizable table structures**  
- Preserve the smooth UX and export flow — without breaking the architecture  

The UI stayed familiar.  
The mental model changed completely.

That’s where the real difficulty was.

## Learning by Reading Real Code

This was the first time I truly experienced how valuable **reading great code** can be.

I spent almost **a full week** doing very little “building” — just reading.

Line by line.  
File by file.

Trying to understand *why* things were written the way they were.

That process taught me more than any tutorial:

- How real projects are structured  
- How abstractions stay simple but flexible  
- How restraint is often a sign of good engineering  

It was slow.  
It was frustrating.  
And it reshaped how I approach code to this day.

## Why This Project Matters

OG Table isn’t the biggest project I’ve shipped.

But it was the project that made everything feel *real*.

It showed me that:
- Small tools can still be meaningful  
- You don’t need a huge idea to ship something useful  
- Open source is one of the fastest ways to level up  
- Understanding existing systems is just as important as creating new ones  

Most importantly, it gave me confidence that I could take a real product, understand it, and bend it toward a completely new goal.

## Tech Stack (at a Glance)

- **Framework**: Next.js  
- **UI**: Radix UI + Tailwind  
- **State Management**: Jotai  
- **Animations**: Framer Motion  
- **Image Export**: html-to-image

OG Table was the beginning.

Not because it was perfect —  
but because it proved that I could learn from real-world code, reshape it, and ship something meaningful.

OG Table is a small project with a big place in my journey.

This was the **first project** that pulled me into the world of *micro-SaaS*, *open source*, and building tools for real people — not just finishing assignments or tutorials.

## Where It Started

I remember this very clearly.

I was deep into YouTube, watching Marc Lou’s content — shipping fast, building in public, tiny tools with real users.  
That was the moment when building software stopped feeling academic and started feeling… *alive*.

Around the same time, I was working on a slide deck.  
Everything looked clean and modern — nice font, subtle gradients, good spacing.

Then I added a table.

And it completely ruined the slide.

It looked like it came straight out of an early-2000s spreadsheet.  
No style. No personality. Just pain.

That’s when the idea hit me:

> “Why does everything else look modern… except tables?”

## The First Real Idea

OG Table came from a **purely personal problem**.

I didn’t start with a business plan.  
I didn’t start with metrics.  
I just wanted tables that *didn’t embarrass my slides*.

So I built a tool where you could:

- Pick a theme  
- Customize borders and corners  
- Adjust spacing and background  
- Export the result as an image  
- Move on with your life  

Simple. Useful. Done.

At the time, that felt revolutionary to me.

## Learning the Hard Way (and the Best Way)

Here’s the fun part.

I didn’t build OG Table from scratch.

I **cloned the ray.so repository** by Raycast:
https://github.com/raycast/ray-so

And wow.

That repo was *clean*.  
Painfully clean.

Every file made sense.  
Every abstraction felt intentional.  
Nothing was rushed.

I remember spending almost **a full week** just reading the code — slowly, line by line — trying to understand *why* things were structured the way they were.

It was frustrating.  
It was exhausting.  
And it was one of the most valuable learning experiences I’ve had.

That week forced me to:

- Get comfortable reading other people’s code  
- Understand real-world project structure  
- Learn that good code is often quiet, boring, and intentional  

That pain trained me more than any tutorial ever did.

## Why This Project Matters to Me

OG Table might not be the biggest or most complex project I’ve built — but it’s the one that **changed how I think**.

It taught me that:

- Small tools can still matter  
- Ideas don’t have to be grand to be useful  
- Open source is an incredible way to learn  
- Reading great code is just as important as writing your own  

Most importantly, it showed me that I *could* build something end-to-end — and that people might actually want to use it.

That realization stuck with me.

OG Table was the beginning.

Not because it was perfect —  
but because it made me believe that building and shipping tools was something I could actually do.
